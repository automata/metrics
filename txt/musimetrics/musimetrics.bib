                  quotations and anecdotes have not been
                  systematically examined. This archival case study of
                  Ludwig van Beethoven remedies this by
                  comprehensively analyzing his self-critical
                  statements.  Explicit self-criticisms of 70
                  compositions were found in Beethoven's letters or
                  conversations, spanning his whole career and most
                  musical forms.  Beethoven's positive or negative
                  assessments are reliably associated with three
                  citation measures of aesthetic success, and the
                  likelihood of correct decisions strongly increased
                  with age. His comments comparing several similar
                  masterpieces are likewise largely consistent with
                  expert ratings and recording counts. Finally, the
                  ranking of works by listener-hours (number of
                  complete recordings multiplied by performance
                  duration) correspond closely to Beethoven's
                  intra-genre preferences. The results suggest
                  considerable self-critical acumen on Beethoven's
                  part. The results support an expertise view of
                  musical creativity in which knowledge and experience

                  consistently found across both productivity measures
                  that quality of productivity was a probabilistic
                  consequence of productive quantity and that total

                  war intensity, and internal disturbances). Due to
                  the more selective nature of the thematic
                  productivity measure, the criterion of total themes
                  alone was affected by competition and a time-wise

                  as a consequence of the rapid growth of the Internet

                  faster and more efficient tools for music content
                  analysis. Musical genres are widely used to organize
                  music collections. In this paper, the problem of
                  automatic single and multi-label music genre
                  classification is addressed by exploring
                  rhythm-based features obtained from a respective
                  complex network representation. A Markov model is
                  built in order to analyse the temporal sequence of
                  rhythmic notation events. Feature analysis is
                  performed by using two multivariate statistical
                  approaches: principal components analysis
                  (unsupervised) and linear discriminant analysis
                  (supervised). Similarly, two classifiers are applied
                  in order to identify the category of rhythms:
                  parametric Bayesian classifier under the Gaussian
                  hypothesis (supervised) and agglomerative
                  hierarchical clustering (unsupervised). Qualitative
                  results obtained by using the kappa coefficient and
                  the obtained clusters corroborated the effectiveness
                  of the proposed method.}
